# Software-Timers-in-FreeRTOS-using-CMSIS
In this project, I developed software timers within the FreeRTOS real-time operating system using CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard). Software timers play a crucial role in task scheduling and management in embedded systems. Leveraging the functionalities provided by CMSIS, I created both periodic and one-shot timers that were seamlessly integrated into our application. This solution facilitates efficient time and resource management, ultimately enhancing the overall system performance. Additionally, I implemented UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) and LED control tasks, showcasing the smooth integration of timers with other microcontroller features. This project deepened my understanding of FreeRTOS, CMSIS, and embedded development, while providing valuable hands-on experience in designing robust and reliable real-time systems.
